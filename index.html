        <h1>Fun Facts</h1>
        <div class="fact">ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· I grew up in BrasÃ­lia, Brazil, and came to the states when I was 16. I learned English from playing video games and watching torrent TV Shows ðŸ‘€</div>
        <div class="fact">ðŸ“º My favorite tv show is I Think You Should Leave. Actually, that is up for discussion as I really love The Office, Friends and Seinfeld.</div>
        <div class="fact">ðŸ’° My biggest lesson when building products are â€” to communicate well. Nothing is stronger than an engaged community that loves and supports your product and vision. On top of that, build an incredible team, align the team around your impactful mission, and move ultra-super fast.</div>
